# LZ77-project_Gil_Shacar
our project.

* Java.
* The LZ77 algorithm compresses data by identifying repetitive sequences. In cases where the repeating sequence has one different letter / symbol added, the algorithm will not recognize it as a repeating sequence. 
* We have improved the algorithm by now identifying and compressing repetitive sequences despite these isolated perturbations.
